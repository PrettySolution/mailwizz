It seems this application does not use a license key which suggests it actually is a nulled application which is illegal to use.<br />
Keep in mind that nulled apps contain backdoors and exploits that can allow full access to this server.<br />
Please make sure you install a proper copy of the application as soon as possible. Once you do this, this message will go away.<br />
Thank you.
